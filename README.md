The `eurorack-blocks` project allows to develop your own custom Eurorack module for either
prototyping or fun in the comfort of your day-to-day IDE and debugging in a
[virtual Eurorack environment](https://vcvrack.com),
and when ready, to auto-magically generate all the needed files to manufacture
the eurorack module for you to use in a real Eurorack modular system.

`eurorack-blocks` is using [`Daisy Patch Submodule`](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/patch-sm),
a DSP platform for Eurorack synthesizer modules. It features a lightning fast STM32 processor,
high fidelity stereo audio codec, and enough RAM for 10 minute long buffers
â€” all with standard signal levels and conditioning for the Eurorack ecosystem.

The [documentation as well as the Getting Started guide can be found on **Read the Docs**](https://eurorack-blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The full project's manifest can be read [here](manifest.md).

#include "artifacts/BypassUi.h"

## Sample Projects

[<img align="right" height="200px" src="./samples/bypass/screenshot.png">](./samples/bypass/)
[<img align="right" height="200px" src="./samples/drop/screenshot.png">](./samples/drop/)
[<img align="right" height="200px" src="./samples/reverb/screenshot.png">](./samples/reverb/)
[<img align="right" height="200px" src="./samples/kick/screenshot.png">](./samples/kick/)

Before reading sample code, make sure to grasp the concepts in the [documentation](https://eurorack-blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Sample projects are a good place to continue learning:

- [`bypass`](./samples/bypass/) is the example used above,
- [`drop`](./samples/drop/) shows the usage of almost every blocks,
- [`reverb`](./samples/reverb/) illustrates how to utilize all the platform memory,
- [`kick`](./samples/kick/) illustrates how to use factory samples and make big programs.


## Setting up

Setting up the development environment is described in the [documentation](https://eurorack-blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/setup.html).


## Structure

```
eurorack-blocks/
   blocks/
   boards/
   build-system/
   include/
   src/
   submodules/
```

- [`blocks`](./blocks/) contains all the atomic blocks hardware for design validation and software tests,
- [`boards`](./blocks/) contains all the boards hardware to design with,
- [`build-system`](./build-system/) contains the build system used to build and deploy
   the tests and samples,
- [`include`](./include/) contains the software implementation of the blocks,
- [`src`](./src/) contains the software implementation of the blocks,
- [`submodules`](./submodules/) contains the software dependencies as submodules.
