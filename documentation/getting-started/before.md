# Before You Start

Eurorack-blocks is currently in development. Should you choose to use it today, consider
yourself in the essential community of early adopters.


## Your feedback is important!

There is no stupid questions, only incomplete documentation. Don't be shy and open an
issue. If the subject is out of scope of Eurorack-blocks, we will try to redirect you to the
relevant documents.


## Some DIY skills are required for now

On the long term, you will be able to receive your hardware module with absolutely no
soldering skills required.

In the meantime, Eurorack-blocks requires some soldering skills:
- The back board requires SMD soldering gear and knowledge,
- The front board requires basic soldering skills using an (ideally temperature-controlled) soldering iron.

We understand that SMD soldering can be off putting but it is probably easier than you
thought. We will provide a video to help with that.

Alternatively, we will make small manufacturing runs of the back board, with the SMD components
already soldered, so that only the THT pin sockets are left to solder, like a lot of other DIY projects.


## Eurorack-blocks is not mature

Eurorack-blocks is a very ambitious project. For this reason we decided to first go wide and
implement all features rather than go specific and have just a few high-quality features.

For this reason, API might change, some code might break and your favorite IDE might not
be supported.


## Contributors are welcomed!

Eurorack-blocks is maintained by essentially one individual which obviously is not enough
given the scope of this project.

If you can help, we will really appreciate it.
