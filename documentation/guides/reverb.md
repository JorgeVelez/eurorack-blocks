# Reverb: Memory Management

[`Reverb`](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks/tree/main/samples/reverb) is
a pre-filtered reverb. This sample illustrates the problem associated when using a "lot" of
memory, here with the reverb delay lines.

## Overview

On embedded platforms, like Daisy, the natively available memory is very limited
compared to what desktop or mobile software developers are used to.
For example, with the STM32H7 and on the Daisy Seed, the stack is only 128KB and
the memory allocator is using a memory called "AXI SRAM", and this memory is only 512KB.

However, this is not all the memory available to your application. The Daisy Seed has for
example a SDRAM chip connected to the main processor, and this SDRAM chip can handle
up to 64MB of memory.

Unlike desktop computers, The Daisy Seed processor, like most embedded processors,
doesn't have a memory management unit (MMU), and the 32-bit addresses available
to your application map directly to the hardware, like the Linux kernel would see them.

Unlike desktop applications, you don't need to allocate memory, you just claim a range
of addresses, and in fact this is your entire responsibility!

Should you use the SRAM or SDRAM, the address space is quite small. And because you
don't have a MMU, memory allocations suffer from the same plague that was hitting old OSes
running on processors with no MMU like the very old Apple Macintosh:
memory fragmentation.

To avoid that, and when possible, allocations are done once and for all using the maximum
possible memory your application could use. Internally, your program uses just a portion of it.

For the rest of this tutorial, if you want to follow along, we will consider that you have
setup your environment properly as described in {doc}`../getting-started/setup`.


## How does it work?

This is the time to open the engine powering the Daisy platform,
called [`libDaisy`](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy). Eurorack-blocks uses it
to access the hardware for all sort of operations. What you have in this chapter is
probably the only thing you need to know about embedded software engineering
when using Eurorack-blocks. Let's dive into it.

When the build process needs to assemble all the different compilation units objects
and consolidate them into one binary, it uses a "linker". When building for the Daisy
platform, we pass in what is called a "linker script".

There are multiple linker scripts for Daisy, depending on some usage, that we will see later.
For now let's focus on the one made to store your program in the ARM internal flash
memory, called [`STM32H750IB_flash.lds`](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy/blob/master/core/STM32H750IB_flash.lds).

```{code-block} text
---
emphasize-lines: 3-5, 9
---
MEMORY
{
   FLASH (RX)    : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
   DTCMRAM (RWX) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 128K
   SRAM (RWX)    : ORIGIN = 0x24000000, LENGTH = 512K
   RAM_D2 (RWX)  : ORIGIN = 0x30000000, LENGTH = 288K
   RAM_D3 (RWX)  : ORIGIN = 0x38000000, LENGTH = 64K
   ITCMRAM (RWX) : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 64K
   SDRAM (RWX)   : ORIGIN = 0xc0000000, LENGTH = 64M
   QSPIFLASH (RX): ORIGIN = 0x90000000, LENGTH = 8M
}
```

The address space is divided into multiple sections, which have a base address, or origin,
and length. The highlighted lines are sections of memory that you use:
- The `FLASH` memory is where your program is stored, this is the file you upload to the
   Daisy using a USB cable,
- The `DTCMRAM` is where your stack lives,
- The `SRAM` (also known as `AXI SRAM`) is where a call to `operator new` or `malloc`
   would allocate to,
- The `SDRAM` is an extra chip next to the ARM chip on the Daisy hardware, that gives an
   additionnal 64MB of memory.

For some modules, you can get to the point where storing samples and delay lines wouldn't
fit on a combination of the `DTCMRAM` and `SRAM` and you need to use the `SDRAM`.

Now maybe a question comes in mind. Why does `malloc` just doesn't care of it, and
allocate into the SDRAM when we are done with the internal SRAM?

Well, that _could_ be done automatically, but there is at least one reason where you wouldn't
want this automatic behavior: **performance**.

Just considering the internal memory, that is your stack and heap space, there are
already speed differences. In fact, the `DTCMRAM` is running at the full processor speed,
but the `AXI SRAM` is only running at half the processor speed! This is a page screenshot
from the [SMT32 system and architecture performance manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/dm00306681-stm32h72x-stm32h73x-and-singlecore-stm32h74x75x-system-architecture-and-performance-stmicroelectronics.pdf):

```

Now accessing the external SDRAM chip is even worse. Performance can be 10 times slower
than the internal `DTCMRAM`, but that depends also a lot on how you fetch data from this chip.

In the end, you typically want your filters memories on the stack. Then the idea is mostly
to put memory buffers in SRAM and SDRAM depending on how big they are, and how
many times they are accessed per audio rendering.

In C++, only you can know about this. In Max, the SRAM is the first choice to fit an object
unless there is not enough space for it, so it goes to SDRAM. In Faust, the transpiler as
some idea on how the memory is used and make some optimisations.

But for now, let's continue with C++.


## Preparing

First let's configure the IDE project to inspect the project in the comfort of our IDE if you
are using one. Navigate to `eurorack-blocks/samples/reverb` and run:

```shell-session
eurorack-blocks$ cd samples/reverb
eurorack-blocks/samples/reverb$ erbb configure
```

If you are using Xcode, you can navigate to the `artifacts` folder and open the
`project_vcvrack.xcodeproj` Xcode project.

If you are using `VSCode`, just open the `reverb` folder in VSCode.

From Xcode, you can build using {guilabel}`âŒ˜B`.
You can also build the VCV Rack module from the command line with:

```shell-session
$ erbb build simulator
```

Now you can open VCV Rack, and add the Reverb module and play a bit with it.


## Smart Pointers

How are the reverb delay lines allocated in `Reverb`? Well for this, we need to look
into the `dsp` Library, and open the `ReverbSc.h` file:

```{code-block} cpp
---
emphasize-lines: 2-3
---
const float    _sample_freq;
erb::SdramPtr <DelayLines>
               _delay_lines_sptr;
DelayStates    _delay_states = {};
```

`erb::SdramPtr` is some sort of (relatively) smart pointer which purpose is to allocate in
the `SDRAM` memory section. Think of it like a `std::unique_ptr`, it is a smart pointer that
owns and manages another object through a pointer.

But there is one catch though: when the smart pointer goes out of scope, it doesn't dispose
of this object and doesn't reclaim the memory.
Why so? Because of the memory fragmentation problem we've talked about earlier.

But there is just one thing you need to remember: those smart pointers are made to allocate
in specific memory regions. This is a one time thing you do when you setup your dsp, and
don't do afterwards.

For `AXI SRAM` you would use `erb::SramPtr`,
and if you need to decide at compile time which region to use,
the convenient `erb::RamPtr` (coming soon) takes a `erb::MemorySection` and use
the appropriate underlying template class.

Finally yes, we also have a `erb::allocate_bytes_auto`, which does this dynamically,
but this is made for automatically generated DSP code, like Max, and is not adviced for C++
programming.

Now you may have a question: how do we know when running on the daisy hardware which
piece of code allocated in the wrong place?
It feels like you would need to plug a debugger to the Daisy hardware, which requires
a dedicated hardware debugger...

This is where the simulator comes to help.


## Simulator

When using the simulator with VCV Rack, we are running on the desktop and don't suffer
from those kinds of problems. But what we can do is to keep track of every allocations in
every memory sections, and break into the debugger when a fault is detected, as it would
happen on the hardware Daisy platform.

You can then detect the problem with your favorite IDE and/or debugger. Thanks to
the callstack, you can see precisely which allocation triggered the problem.

```{code-block} cpp
static constexpr size_t max_time_spl
   = 4127 + size_t (max_sample_freq * 0.0017f) + 17 /* 16.5 */;
```

In `ReverbSc.h`, try to change the value of `max_time_spl` to a ridiculously big number like `8000000`,
and then launch VCV Rack, attach your debugger, and finally add a `Reverb` module.

With Xcode the debugger would break as soon as you would try to drop a Reverb module instance
on your Rack:

If you go back to the line 13 in the callstack highlighted on the left, you will find the culprit line!
